This project was developed during my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering to solve a personal challenge: managing my growing collection of electronic components acquired over the years.

## üöÄ Goal

The application allows me to:

- Register electronic components with their name, model, type, and description.
- Manage stock entries and outputs.
- Search and update existing components.
- Track all data through a secure REST API.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- **Laravel 8** (backend & frontend)
- **MySQL** for data storage
- **Laravel Sanctum** for authentication
- **Tailwind CSS** for UI styling
- **Blade Templates** for views
- **Swagger UI** for API documentation
- **Postman** for API testing

## üß± Architecture

The system integrates:

- A web frontend for direct use
- A RESTful API for integration with other frontends or mobile apps
- Authentication and CRUD operations for components
- An admin interface for component management and stock monitoring

## üì± Future Improvements

- Mobile app using the existing API
- Enhanced search and filter features
- Responsive tables and dashboard analytics
